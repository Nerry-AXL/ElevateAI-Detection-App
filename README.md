## Project Overview

The ElevateAI Detection App is built to provide users with the ability to detect objects, identify patterns, and classify elements within images and video streams. This application is part of the ElevateAI suite of tools aimed at enhancing automation and accuracy in various computer vision tasks.

## Features

- **Real-Time Object Detection:** Detect objects in images and video feeds in real-time.
- **Image Classification:** Classify images based on pre-defined categories using trained models.
- **Customizable Models:** Support for integrating custom-trained models for specific detection tasks.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** A simple and intuitive interface for uploading images or videos and viewing detection results.

## Installation

To run the ElevateAI Detection App locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Nerry-AXL/ElevateAI-Detection-App.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd ElevateAI-Detection-App
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Dependencies

The main dependencies for this project include:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (depending on the model used)
- OpenCV
- Streamlit (for web-based interface)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

## Usage

1. **Start the application:**

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

2. **Access the app interface:**
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to access the ElevateAI Detection App.

3. **Upload an image or video:**
   Use the interface to upload an image or video file for analysis.

4. **View detection results:**
   The app will display the detected objects, classifications, and any relevant statistics or visualizations.

5. **Custom Model Integration:**
   To use a custom model, replace the default model file in the `models/` directory with your custom model and update the corresponding code in `app.py` to load and utilize the new model.

## Model Details

- **Pre-trained Models:** The app comes with pre-trained models for general object detection tasks.
- **Custom Models:** Users can integrate custom models trained on specific datasets for specialized detection tasks.

### Supported Models

- **YOLO (You Only Look Once):** Fast and accurate object detection model.
- **ResNet:** Deep neural network model for image classification.
- **SSD (Single Shot Detector):** Efficient object detection model for real-time applications.

## Results

The ElevateAI Detection App provides detailed results for each uploaded image or video, including:

- Bounding boxes around detected objects.
- Classification labels for detected objects.
- Confidence scores for each detection.
- Visualizations of the detection process.
